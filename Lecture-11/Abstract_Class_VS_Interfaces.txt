Abstract Class
- support abstract and Non-abstract methods
- Doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance
- Abstract classes can be extended by Java classes and multiple interfaces
- Abstract class members in Java can be private, protected, etc.
- Example:
  public abstract class Vechicle{
    public abstract void drive()
  }



Interfaces
- abstract methods only
- Supports Multiple Inheritance
- extended by Java interface only
- Interfaces are public by default (makes sense bcz it don't have body and so that subclass must provide)
- Example:
  public interface Animal{
    void speak();
  }
