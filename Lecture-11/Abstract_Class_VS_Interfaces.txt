Abstract Class
support abstract and Non-abstract methods
Doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance
Abstract classes can be extended by Java classes and multiple interfaces
Abstract class members in Java can be private, protected, etc.



Interfaces
abstract methods only
Supports Multiple Inheritance
extended by Java interface only
Interfaces are public by default (makes sense bcz it don't have body and so that subclass must provide)
